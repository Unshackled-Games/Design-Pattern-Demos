When to use: add functionality to objects dynamically.
Problem: subclassing for every feature combination causes class explosion.
How it works: decorator classes wrap the original object and implement the same interface while adding behavior.
Benefits: flexibly mix features at runtime without altering the base class.
Example: adding buffering or compression layers to a stream.
