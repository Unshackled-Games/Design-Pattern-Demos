When to use: object creation logic should be centralized or simplified.
Problem: client code should not depend on concrete classes or constructors.
How it works: define a factory method that returns the appropriate subclass based on input or configuration.
Benefits: decouples instantiation from use and eases substitution of implementations.
Example: a shape factory that returns different shape objects at runtime.
