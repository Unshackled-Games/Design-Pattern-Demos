When to use: manage access to an object that is expensive or sensitive.
Problem: clients may need lazy initialization, caching, or security checks before using the real object.
How it works: a proxy implements the same interface and adds the access logic before delegating to the real subject.
Benefits: transparent control over the actual object and additional behavior without modification.
Example: virtual proxies loading data on demand or remote proxies controlling network access.
