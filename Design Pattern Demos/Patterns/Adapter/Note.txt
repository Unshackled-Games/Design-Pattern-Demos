When to use: integrate classes with incompatible interfaces.
Problem: existing code expects one interface while another class provides different methods.
How it works: write an adapter that implements the expected interface and delegates to the adaptee.
Benefits: reuse legacy or third-party code without modification.
Tip: keep adapters lightweight so they only translate calls.
