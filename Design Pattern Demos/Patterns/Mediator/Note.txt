When to use: many objects communicate in complex ways and dependencies must be minimized.
Problem: direct object references lead to a tangled web of interactions.
How it works: a mediator object coordinates communication among colleague objects.
Benefits: centralizes interaction logic and reduces coupling between components.
Example: a chat room where participants send messages through a mediator.
