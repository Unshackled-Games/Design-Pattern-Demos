When to use: choose among multiple algorithms or behaviors at runtime.
Problem: embedding algorithm choices in conditional statements reduces flexibility.
How it works: define a family of strategy classes sharing a common interface and switch them interchangeably.
Benefits: easy to extend algorithms independently from the clients that use them.
Example: different sorting strategies selected based on data size.
