When to use: several handlers may respond to the same request.
Problem: chaining if/else statements couples clients to specific handlers.
How it works: each handler processes the request or passes it to the next handler in the chain.
Benefits: dynamic composition and flexible ordering of responsibilities.
Example: middleware pipelines or UI event bubbling.
