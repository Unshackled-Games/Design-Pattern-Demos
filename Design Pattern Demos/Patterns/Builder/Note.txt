When to use: complex objects need to be constructed step by step.
Problem: many constructor parameters or optional parts make instantiation messy.
How it works: provide a builder with fluent methods to configure parts, then call Build() to get the result.
Benefits: clearer creation code and guarantees fully initialized objects.
Example: assembling a car or composing a multi-page document.
