When to use: creating new objects is expensive or complex.
Problem: constructing an object from scratch involves many steps or resource usage.
How it works: clone an existing prototype to produce new objects quickly.
Benefits: simplified creation of similar objects and reduced initialization cost.
Example: duplicating graphic elements in a drawing application.
