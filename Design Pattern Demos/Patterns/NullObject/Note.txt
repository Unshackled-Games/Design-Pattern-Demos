When to use: eliminate null checks by providing a do-nothing implementation.
Problem: clients constantly guard against null references before calling methods.
How it works: supply an object that conforms to the interface but performs neutral behavior.
Benefits: simplifies calling code and avoids NullReferenceException errors.
Example: a logger that silently ignores all messages in a production build.
