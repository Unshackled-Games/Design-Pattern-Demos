When to use: requests should be parameterized or queued as objects.
Problem: callers are tightly coupled to the specific actions they invoke.
How it works: encapsulate an action and its receiver inside a command class with Execute().
Benefits: enables undo/redo, logging, and flexible invocation of operations.
Example: menu items creating command objects executed by an invoker.
