When to use: objects should react to state changes in another object.
Problem: manual polling or tight coupling between observers and subjects is hard to maintain.
How it works: observers subscribe to a subject and are notified automatically when changes occur.
Benefits: promotes loose coupling and enables event-driven systems.
Example: GUI components updating when underlying data models change.
