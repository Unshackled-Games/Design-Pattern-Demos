When to use: separate abstraction from implementation so both can vary.
Problem: multiple inheritance hierarchies lead to class explosion.
How it works: create an abstraction interface and an implementation interface linked via composition.
Benefits: extend either side independently and reduce coupling.
Example: UI widgets delegating drawing to platform-specific renderers.
