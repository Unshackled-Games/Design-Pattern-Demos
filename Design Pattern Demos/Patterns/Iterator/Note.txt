When to use: traverse elements of a collection without exposing its structure.
Problem: clients depend on collection implementation to loop through items.
How it works: an iterator object provides operations to access elements sequentially.
Benefits: multiple traversals and different iteration strategies become possible.
Example: IEnumerable and IEnumerator interfaces in C#.
