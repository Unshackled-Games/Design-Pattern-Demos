When to use: provide undo or rollback functionality without exposing internal state.
Problem: storing state externally violates encapsulation.
How it works: the originator creates a memento object representing its state and restores from it when needed.
Benefits: encapsulated snapshots enable undo stacks and state checkpoints.
Example: text editors storing previous document versions for undo.
