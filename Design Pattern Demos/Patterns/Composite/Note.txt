When to use: work with individual objects and groups through one interface.
Problem: special-casing leaves and groups makes client code complex.
How it works: define a component interface implemented by both leaf and composite classes.
Benefits: treats the whole structure uniformly and simplifies hierarchy management.
Example: graphics editors where shapes can be nested groups.
